Goal: Build a single-page Coming Soon website for Rove — an AI‑powered Cycle‑Sync Period Tracker and Cycle‑Sync Supplement brand for Indian women.

Overall Aesthetic:

Tech × Clinical duality: dark, modern, “AI lab” vibe + soft, clinical trust.

Background: deep plum/ink gradient with a subtle animated grid and a faint ECG/molecule line moving slowly across the hero.

Foreground cards: glassmorphism (backdrop‑blur, soft borders, ivory highlights).

Typography: Inter (or similar), premium, spacious.

Color tokens:

Background: #0D0A10 → #1A0F1A gradient

Accents: plum #6E3B6E, blush #F4C4D4, mint #CFE8E5, ivory #F6F2F8

Micro‑animations: fade/slide on scroll, hover lift on cards, gentle button pulse.

Structure (single page, anchored nav):

Hero (Top)

H1: “Cycle‑Synced Wellness, Powered by AI.”

Sub: “A medical‑grade coach that adapts your diet, exercise, and care to each phase of your cycle.”

Primary CTA button → “Join Waitlist” (scroll to form)

Secondary CTA (ghost) → “Learn More” (scroll to teasers)

Background: animated tech grid + subtle ECG/molecule line; soft gradient glow behind H1.

One polished, animated page; teasers for both the AI tracker and supplement; primary Join Waitlist flow works and shows success state; layout looks premium on mobile & desktop.
